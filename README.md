# OSM API Docs

Unofficial OpenAPI definition for the Online Scout Manager (OSM) API,
derived from observed requests and responses used by City of Newcastle Scouts.

## Contents

- `openapi.yaml`: OpenAPI 3.0 spec for observed endpoints.
- `index.html`: Redoc UI for browsing the spec.

## Viewing the docs

Open `index.html` in a browser. It loads `openapi.yaml` into Redoc.

## Notes

- This spec is incomplete and reflects only endpoints seen so far.
- Be mindful of privacy and GDPR when handling member data.

## Contributing

We welcome PRs to improve the OpenAPI spec.
